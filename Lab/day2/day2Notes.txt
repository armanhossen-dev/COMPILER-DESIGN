# DFA based pattern recognition
//Deterministic Finite Automata


# Problem statement: write a C program to recognize string 
AIM: identify strings from the input string.

//what is string? how to identify string?
Algorithm/Procedure:
By using transition diagram we verify input of the state.
If the state recognize the given pattern rule.
Then print string is accepted under a*/a*b+/abb.
Else print string not accepted
//write a c program to recognize any type of string.

//what is pattern?
relation between pattern with compiler


//example pattern string identify
a*
a*b+
abb
